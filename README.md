## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://dann-lam.github.io/04-02-2023-Quiz-Homework/)

This is a simple quiz type site that features a countdown, a highscoreboard stored on your local storage, and many fun questions to run through.

It may look quite simple, but it has all the functionality required.

We created this because it exercises the fundamentals of how selector IDs work, how a countdown could be implemented, and how event listeners function, and how local storage can be used. It also requries some basic logic on handling objects.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Learning Points


The learning process was quite difficult, as many new concepts were not only introduced, but implemented in ways that coelescesed into one project. The most interesting learning point for me was understanding the way to sort values in objects, and the many joys of starting and stopping intervals.

What I'd like to work on: Currently my implementation of deciding what to display is a little silly, in the future I'd like to improve that and figure out what more efficient ways of displaying that would be.
